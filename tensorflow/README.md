# TensorFlow Networks for the Intel<sup><sup><sup>®</sup></sup></sup> NCS 2 (or original NCS) with OpenVINO<sup><sup><sup>™</sup></sup></sup> toolkit
This directory contains multiple subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains software, data, and instructions that pertain to using a specific TensorFlow neural network with a Neural Compute device such as the Intel<sup><sup><sup>®</sup></sup></sup> NCS 2.  Along with the trained network itself, examples are provided via Makefile that show how the OpenVINO Model Optimizer can be used to compile the network to Intermediate Representation (IR) and also how to create a program that uses that IR model for inferencing.  The sections below are categorized by network type and include a brief explaination of each network.
